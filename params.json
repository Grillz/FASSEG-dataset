{"name":"FASSEG dataset","tagline":"A Face Semantic Segmentation dataset","body":"# FASSEG dataset\r\n\r\nWelcome to the webpage of the FAce Semantic SEGmentation (FASSEG) dataset.\r\n\r\nThe FASSEG dataset is made available here in two versions:\r\n\r\n- **V1** contains 70 labeled faces and the original RGB images. **This is exactly the same dataset we used in our paper** [1]. Faces are mainly taken from the MIT-CBCL[2] and FEI[3] datasets. Images are organized in two folders - train and test -  matching the division we adopted in the paper.\r\n\r\n- **V2** is an *\"high-precision V1\"*. It contains the same images as the V1 but it's much more precise in the segmentations (see images below). We also introduced a different convention for the \"nose\" class, which is extended up to the level of the eyes.  \r\n\r\n![RGB image](https://github.com/massimomauro/FASSEG-dataset/blob/master/V1/Train_RGB/10.bmp)\r\n![V1 Labeling](https://github.com/massimomauro/FASSEG-dataset/blob/master/V1/Train_Labels/10.bmp)\r\n![V2 Labeling](https://github.com/massimomauro/FASSEG-dataset/blob/master/V2/Train_Labels/10.bmp)\r\n\r\nOur advice is: if you need to compare with our results, choose V1. If you need a dataset to build your models, choose V2.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if you use our datasets, please cite our work [1].\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] *Massimo Mauro*, *Khalil Khan*, *Riccardo Leonardi*, **\"Multi-class semantic segmentation of faces\"**, International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), 2015\r\n\r\n[2] *MIT Center for Biological and Computational Learning (CBCL)*, **MIT-CBCL database**, [http://cbcl.mit.edu/software-datasets/FaceData2.html](http://cbcl.mit.edu/software-datasets/FaceData2.html)\r\n\r\n[3] *Centro Universitario da FEI*, **FEI database**,\r\n[http://www.fei.edu.br/~cet/facedatabase.html](http://www.fei.edu.br/~cet/facedatabase.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
